- [ ] Document all configuration options
- [ ] Add environment-specific settings files

### 12. Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Implement automated database backups
- [ ] Set up configuration backup procedures
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Document backup and recovery processes

## üß™ Code Quality & Testing Tasks (LOW PRIORITY)

### 13. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Add comprehensive production-level testing
- [ ] Set up continuous integration/deployment pipeline
- [ ] Configure test coverage reporting
- [ ] Add integration tests for critical user flows

### 14. Code Quality
- [ ] Complete type hints throughout the codebase
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement proper validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Add code quality checks in CI/CD

## ‚úâÔ∏è Additional Production Features (LOW PRIORITY)

### 15. Email Configuration

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Basic Django project structure
- ‚úÖ Docker development setup
- ‚úÖ Basic user authentication
- ‚úÖ Type hints (partially implemented)
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database configuration
- ‚ùå Production security settings
- ‚ùå Production server configuration
- ‚ùå Logging configuration
- ‚ùå Monitoring setup

## Notes

- The project is currently using Django's development server (`runserver`) which is not suitable for production
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"]` is a security risk and must be changed for production
- No logging configuration is currently in place
- Static files are configured but need optimization for production serving
